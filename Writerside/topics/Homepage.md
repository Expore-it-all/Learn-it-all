# Homepage

A repository for all my learning experiences. This is a resource for me to learn from and use as I dive into different topics.
This can be everything from different programing languages, backend frameworks, frontend frameworks, hardware, game design, and other random tib bits that I run into.

## Preface
I would not say that I am an expert, I currently only have 5 years of experience as a Software developer, but I feel that documenting my learning is one of the better ways to fully integrate new knowledge into my work and hobbies.
I also feel that one of the best ways to learn is to make it bad, find out why it was bad, and then realize how to avoid that in the future. So these "projects" that I explore will be probably bad at first as I dive into them, but hopefully will be good by the end of the project.

<warning>
Also warning, I suck at spelling. So if there are typos, incorrect grammar, or other oddities, 
think of them as the spice of life and not that I have become dependent on spell check to save my butt.
Also I majored in Software Engineering, not English. :)
