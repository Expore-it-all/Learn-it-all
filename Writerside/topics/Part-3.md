We can accept connections. Now we need to be able to read them. Right now I'm going to piggy back off of the [Single threaded HTTP server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html) from The Rust Programming Language Book.
It's a simple implementation, and it gets the job done! We will be doing a plain text protocol. No fancy binary yet.
